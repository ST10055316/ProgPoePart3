My cybersecurity awareness application's main logic engine is the CyberAwarenessChatbot class. Quizzes, tasks, reminders, activity recording, user interaction flow, and the chatbot's knowledge store are all managed by it. In essence, it interprets user input, pulls pertinent data from its knowledge base on cybersecurity subjects, monitors user progress through assignments and tests, and produces pertinent answers to enlighten and instruct the user on digital safety. It serves as the interactive assistant's brain, offering useful functions for cyber hygiene as well as instructional information.
